# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This is a simple implementation of the classic game where you can compete against the computer in a battle of wits. The game is designed to be played in the browser console. This project serves as a starting point for learning JavaScript and web development.

## How to Play

1. Click one of the buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors to make your choice.
2. The game will display the winner for the current round and update the round counter.
3. After 5 rounds, the final winner will be declared.
4. A "Play Again" button will appear, allowing you to reset the game.

## Updates

- Added a "Play Again" button.
- Improved game logic and round tracking.
- Disabled button functionality after 5 rounds.

## Future Enhancements

In a future version of this project, I plan to:

- Add a "Play Again" button.

Stay tuned for updates!
