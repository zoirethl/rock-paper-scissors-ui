# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This is a simple implementation of the classic game where you can compete against the computer in a battle of wits. The game is designed to be played in the browser console. This project serves as a starting point for learning JavaScript and web development.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Open the browser console (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) to see the game output.

### Game Rules

- You can play five rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- Type your choice in the console when prompted: 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors.'
- The computer will randomly select its choice.
- The game will determine the winner of each round and keep track of the score.
- The overall winner will be declared at the end of the game.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-understand code.
- A basic HTML interface to display game instructions (future plans for GUI).
- JavaScript functions to handle player choices and game logic.
- Score tracking to declare the game winner.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Follow the game instructions in the browser console.

## Future Enhancements

In a future version of this project, I plan to:

- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and text for a more interactive experience.
- Allow customization of the number of rounds.
- Add additional features and improvements for a more polished user experience.

Stay tuned for updates!
